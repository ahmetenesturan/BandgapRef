Low Voltage Bandgap Reference Circuit and Wideswing Current Mirror in Skywater 130nm Technology

This project includes two Wideswing Current Mirrors (PMOS and NMOS) and a Bandgap Reference Generator with Constant to Absolute Temperature (CTAT) voltage and current outputs. Users can scale the tail resistor or current mirror width/length to adjust the output voltage or current, respectively.
